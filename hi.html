        <h1 id="hi">Hi</h1>
        <h2 id="subtitle">An introduction about myself. My introduction.</h2>
        <p>Utkarsh has been working since 2016, when he was still doing his graduation. After completing his graduation,
            he started working in Larsen & Toubro as an operation associate. His job there was about managing the cloud
            environment of the clients. He has always been a people’s person and someone who gets bored really quickly
            with repetitive tasks. With the help of his managers he started automating processes and soon had automated
            major team tasks. All in all, he takes pride in the fact that his automation saves 1000hr every month for
            his team. With this feat, he was moved up to a single person team of automations and given a full-time work
            to simplify and solve problems.</p>
        <p>This helped him meet with people from different fields and expertise who wanted automations and other
            solutions for themselves. This led to his passion for people and also got him the nick for solving problems
            and making repetitive and mundane tasks obsolete.</p>

        <p>Utkarsh always had an interest in teaching. He teaches his students with a different, more casual approach.
            Considering his students equal to himself and teaching them like friends. During his time in L&T, he tutored
            in a class called ‘Semicolon’ created by a friend who now works at Google. At Semicolon, Utkarsh used a
            project-based learning approach to teach Python and Flask.</p>
        <p>During all this time, Utkarsh realized that his degree didn’t have much use anywhere. Nothing that was
            taught to him had been useful. What was being taught to him and what was needed were very different. That
            led him to work in the direction of improving this experience for students to come.</p>
        <p>That’s when he met with people from Eniak and found their idea interesting and personal. With his technical,
            people and project management skills, Utkarsh now helps with developing applications, solutions and cloud
            for Eniak. He also helps in project management for few major applications. Along with that, he also takes
            care of interviewing new developers or people of other fields.</p>
        <p>With Eniak, Utkarsh wishes to move the syllabus to more subjective fields, like arts and human sciences that
            allows people to improve their way of expression and built better creators, artists and what not.</p>
