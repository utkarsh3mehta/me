        <h2 id="subtitle">So happy you're here.</h2>
        <p>I've been working since 2016, when I was still doing my graduation. After completing that,
            I started working in Larsen & Toubro as an operations associate. My job there was about managing the cloud
            environment for clients. I have always been someone who gets bored really quickly
            with repetitive tasks. With the help of my managers I started automating processes and soon had automated
            major team tasks. All in all, I take pride in the fact that my automation saved more than 1000hr every month
            for
            my team. With this feat, I was promoted to a single person team of automations and given a "full-time" work
            to simplify and solve problems.</p>
        <p>This helped me meet with people from different fields and expertise who wanted automations and other
            solutions for themselves. This led to my passion for people and also got me the nick for solving problems
            and making repetitive and mundane tasks automated and a thing of the past.</p>
        <p>I always had an interest in teaching. I try to teach my fellow humans with a different, more casual approach.
            Considering them equal and teaching them like friends. During my time in L&T, I tutored
            in a class called ‘Semicolon’ created by a friend who now works at Google. At Semicolon, I used a
            project-based learning approach to teach Python and Flask.</p>
        <p>During all this time, I realized that my degree doesn't have much use anywhere. Nothing that was
            taught to me had been useful. What had being taught and what was needed were very different. That
            led me to work in the direction of improving this experience for students to come.</p>
        <p>That’s when I met with people from Eniak and found their idea interesting and personal. With my technical,
            people and project management skills, I now help with developing applications, coming up with solutions and
            managing cloud
            for Eniak. I also help in project management for a few major applications. Along with that, I also take
            care of interviewing new developers or people of other fields.</p>
        <p>With Eniak, I wish to move the syllabus to more subjective fields, like arts and human sciences that
            allows people to improve their way of expression and build better creators, artists and people in general.
